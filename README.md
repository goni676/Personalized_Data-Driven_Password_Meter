## Installation
Run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Unzip PPESrank-master into a directory of your choise.

## Run the Python Server
In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder and run the Python server:
```bash
python app.py
```
You should see output indicating that the Flask development server is running.
Here's an example of what the terminal output might look like:
```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Once you see this output, your Flask server is up and running and ready to handle incoming HTTP requests.
To access the Flask application, open a web browser and enters the URL of the application in the address bar. 
This URL typically consists of the host and port where your Flask server is running (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/).
